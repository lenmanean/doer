# RLS Security Audit Results

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **ALL TABLES SECURE**

## Executive Summary

All critical tables in the database have Row Level Security (RLS) **ENABLED** with proper policies in place. Users can **only** access their own data. The earlier concern about missing RLS was unfounded - the security configuration is solid.

## Detailed Results

### Table Security Status

| Table | RLS Status | Policy Count | Security Assessment |
|-------|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| `plans` | ✅ ENABLED | 8 policies | ✅ SECURE |
| `milestones` | ✅ ENABLED | 4 policies | ✅ SECURE |
| `tasks` | ✅ ENABLED | 4 policies | ✅ SECURE |
| `task_completions` | ✅ ENABLED | 4 policies | ✅ SECURE |
| `task_schedule` | ✅ ENABLED | 4 policies | ✅ SECURE |
| `onboarding_responses` | ✅ ENABLED | 4 policies | ✅ SECURE |
| `user_profiles` | ✅ ENABLED | 4 policies | ✅ SECURE |
| `health_snapshots` | ✅ ENABLED | 2 policies | ✅ SECURE |

### Policy Breakdown by Table

#### Plans Table
- ✅ Users can view own plans
- ✅ Users can view their own plans *(duplicate)*
- ✅ Users can create own plans
- ✅ Users can insert their own plans *(duplicate)*
- ✅ Users can update own plans
- ✅ Users can update their own plans *(duplicate)*
- ✅ Users can delete own plans
- ✅ Users can delete their own plans *(duplicate)*

**Note:** The plans table has duplicate policies (8 instead of 4). This is harmless but indicates migrations were run multiple times or overlapping migrations exist.

#### Milestones Table
- ✅ Users can view their own milestones
- ✅ Users can insert their own milestones
- ✅ Users can update their own milestones
- ✅ Users can delete their own milestones

#### Tasks Table
- ✅ Users can view their own tasks
- ✅ Users can insert their own tasks
- ✅ Users can update their own tasks
- ✅ Users can delete their own tasks

#### Task Completions Table
- ✅ Users can view their own task completions
- ✅ Users can insert their own task completions
- ✅ Users can update their own task completions
- ✅ Users can delete their own task completions

#### Task Schedule Table
- ✅ Users can view their own task schedules
- ✅ Users can insert their own task schedules
- ✅ Users can update their own task schedules
- ✅ Users can delete their own task schedules

#### Onboarding Responses Table
- ✅ Users can view their own onboarding responses
- ✅ Users can insert their own onboarding responses
- ✅ Users can update their own onboarding responses
- ✅ Users can delete their own onboarding responses

#### User Profiles Table
- ✅ Users can view their own profile
- ✅ Users can view public profiles (where share_achievements = true)
- ✅ Users can insert their own profile
- ✅ Users can update their own profile

#### Health Snapshots Table
- ✅ Users can view own health snapshots
- ✅ System can capture health snapshots (service role)

## Security Model

### Access Control Pattern
All tables use the standard pattern:
```sql
USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id)
```

This ensures:
- **SELECT:** Users can only see their own data
- **INSERT:** Users can only create records for themselves
- **UPDATE:** Users can only modify their own records
- **DELETE:** Users can only delete their own records

### Exception: User Profiles
The `user_profiles` table has an additional policy:
- Users can view profiles where `share_achievements = true`
- This allows for community features while respecting privacy settings

## Grant Permissions

All critical tables grant full privileges to the `authenticated` role:
- SELECT
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE
- REFERENCES
- TRIGGER
- TRUNCATE

**Important:** These grants are safe because RLS policies restrict what authenticated users can actually access.

## Issues & Recommendations

### ⚠️ Minor Issue: Duplicate Policies on Plans Table

The `plans` table has 8 policies when it should have 4. The duplicates are:
- "Users can view own plans" vs "Users can view their own plans"
- "Users can create own plans" vs "Users can insert their own plans"
- "Users can update own plans" vs "Users can update their own plans"
- "Users can delete own plans" vs "Users can delete their own plans"

**Impact:** None - duplicate policies are harmless, they just make the policy list cluttered.

**Recommendation:** Clean up duplicate policies (see cleanup script below).

### ✅ No Security Issues Found

- All tables have RLS enabled
- All policies correctly check `auth.uid() = user_id`
- No tables are exposed without policies
- No overly permissive policies found

## Cleanup Script

To remove duplicate policies from the plans table:

```sql
-- Drop the older policy names (keeping the newer ones)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own plans" ON public.plans;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create own plans" ON public.plans;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own plans" ON public.plans;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own plans" ON public.plans;

-- The following policies will remain:
-- - Users can view their own plans
-- - Users can insert their own plans
-- - Users can update their own plans
-- - Users can delete their own plans
```

## Conclusion

✅ **Your database is secure!**

The original concern about missing RLS was based on incomplete migration file searches. The actual database has proper RLS enabled on all tables with appropriate policies.

**Key Takeaway:** Always verify the actual database state, not just the migration files, as migrations may have been applied from sources not visible in the current migration directory.

## How to Re-run Verification

To verify RLS status at any time:

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the script: `supabase/migrations/verify_rls_status.sql`
3. Review the output sections:
   - RLS Status
   - Policy Information
   - Critical Tables Status
   - Grant Permissions
   - Security Assessment

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Security audit complete - no action needed
2. 🔧 (Optional) Clean up duplicate policies on plans table
3. 📝 Document this security model for future reference
4. 🔄 Re-run verification after any schema changes
