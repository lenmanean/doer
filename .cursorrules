# Terminal Command Rules

## MCP Terminal Server (cmd-mcp)
- **ALWAYS use the MCP `execute_command` tool for ALL terminal/command operations**
- **NEVER use the built-in terminal tool (`run_terminal_cmd`)**
- **NEVER use any other terminal execution methods**

The `cmd-mcp` MCP server provides the `execute_command` tool which:
- Executes commands via PowerShell on Windows
- Returns stdout, stderr, and exit codes properly
- Handles errors gracefully
- Properly captures output on Windows (unlike the default terminal tool)

When you need to execute any terminal command:
1. **MUST use the MCP tool** (look for `mcp_*_execute_command` or similar MCP tool names)
2. This ensures proper output capture on Windows
3. All command execution must go through the MCP server, never the built-in terminal

**Rule**: If both the MCP `execute_command` tool and `run_terminal_cmd` are available, ALWAYS choose the MCP tool. The built-in terminal tool should be considered disabled/not available.
