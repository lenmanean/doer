## 📊 Database Schema

The `user_profiles` table includes:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | uuid | Primary key |
| `user_id` | uuid | Foreign key to auth.users (unique) |
| `display_name` | text | User's display name |
| `bio` | text | User bio |
| `avatar_url` | text | Profile picture URL |
| `share_achievements` | boolean | Opt-in for achievement banner |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | timestamptz | Last update timestamp |

## 🔒 Security (RLS Policies)

- ✅ Users can view their own profile
- ✅ Users can view profiles of users who share achievements
- ✅ Users can update only their own profile
- ✅ Users can insert only their own profile
- ✅ Auto-creation trigger for new signups

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run the migration** (see instructions above)
2. **Test the profile system** in your app
3. **Optional**: Add avatar upload functionality later
4. **Optional**: Build achievement system to populate the banner

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Migration fails with "table already exists"
The migration includes `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses, so it should be safe to re-run. If you still have issues:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.user_profiles CASCADE;
-- Then re-run the migration
```

### Profile not loading in the app
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify migration ran successfully in Supabase
3. Check RLS policies are enabled
4. Ensure user is authenticated

### Changes not saving
1. Check Network tab in browser dev tools
2. Look for 401/403 errors (auth/permission issues)
3. Verify API route is working: `GET http://localhost:3000/api/profile`

## 📝 Notes

- All existing users will automatically get a profile created with their email username
- New users will get a profile created automatically on signup
- The system is backwards compatible - fallbacks to email if no profile exists
- Profile data is separate from plan/onboarding data for better organization
